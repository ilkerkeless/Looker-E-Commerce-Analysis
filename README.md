# Looker-E-Commerce-Analysis
E-Commerce analytics project built with SQL in BigQuery and interactive dashboards in Power BI, focusing on profitability, sales performance, and traffic source analysis

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce performance from an end-to-end Business Intelligence perspective. Sales, product, cost, and user data were processed using SQL in Google BigQuery, and interactive dashboards were built in Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis covers profitability, sales trends, customer behavior, and traffic source performance, enabling a clear understanding of which brands, categories, and channels contribute most to overall business success.
